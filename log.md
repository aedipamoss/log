Scratch that, this thing called a "blog" is a bit over done. Don't you think?

Here we have it. A record of some random things which have no goal other than to be written.

Does that make them worth reading? Doubtful.

Anyways, [notes](https://aedipamoss.github.io/notes/) will be where that will be.

## auto deploying logs
{{ .Timestamp "2018-03-25T14:49:26" }}

Setup a pipeline using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/aedipamoss/log) to auto build and deploy this [log to gh-pages](https://github.com/aedipamoss/log).

It should be viewable online [here](https://aedipamoss.github.io/log/).
